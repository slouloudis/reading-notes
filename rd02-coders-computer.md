# The Coders Computer - 

## Text Editors and Code Editors

A document editor is what it is - you get what you see. Think word, google docs, pages ect. 

In comparison, text editors like VS Code, Sublime Text and Brackets let you write code that is later rendered elsewhere - such as the browser. 

An IDE - **intergrated development environment** - is a text editor with several other features, like a compiler and debugger. They can be language specific. Can be resource intensive, but has many features.  


## The Terminal 

Also called the command line, it's a text based way to interact with files on your system, the same way you might use the File Explorer on windows. 

`ls` = list files

    To show hidden files, use `ls -a`
    
`pwd` = print working directory 

`cd` = change directory

`..` = go up a directory 

`mkdir` = directory

`touch filename.txt` = create a new file.

I've also done `add` `commit` `push` `pull` `clone` using Git. 

### Two types of paths, absolute and relative.

Absolute paths will use your root directory to find a file. A relative path will find a file within the directory you're currently in. 

Absolute paths will begin with / while relative paths won't. 

tilde key (~) is a shortcut for your home directory. 

using . will reference your current directory (like relative paths)

.. will reference the parent directory. 


## Files

To identify files types it will query a MIME type. (Something with the internet?) Using file content sniffers -
