#The Coders Computer - 

## The Terminal 

Also called the command line, it's a text based way to interact with files on your system, the same way you might use the File Explorer on windows. 

`ls` = list files

    To show hidden files, use `ls -a`
    
`pwd` = print working directory 

`cd` = change directory

`..` = go up a directory 

`mkdir` = directory

`touch filename.txt` = create a new file.

I've also done `add` `commit` `push` `pull` `clone` using Git. 

###Two types of paths, absolute and relative.

Absolute paths will use your root directory to find a file. A relative path will find a file within the directory you're currently in. 

Absolute paths will begin with / while relative paths won't. 

tilde key (~) is a shortcut for your home directory. 
using . will reference your current directory (like relative paths)
.. will reference the parent directory.
