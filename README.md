## Growth Mindset :thinking:

A growth mindset is *essential* to personal development. It's the ability to take a positive, can-do attitude, especially when facing unfamiliar tasks or trying to learn a new skill. To give an example from my personal life, many people see being artistic as an inborn talent - I know this isn't true, it's just that most artists started young and kept going. It's persistence and **focused** practice that lead to great work, not an innate ability. 

However reading through the article, I related to the authors tendency to sometimes throw his hands up and avoid the issue. To try and improve my own growth mindset, especially at this essential time where I'm beginning a tough course, I need to remind myself of the following: 

> - It's okay to get criticism. While it can feel a bit painful in the moment, constructive criticisms is just someone trying to help you push your abilities to their best. Take a breath and properly think about what they said. 
> * Try to find inspiration in others - I always feel more motivated when I see peers create something new, or interesting projects on the internet. I feel the urge to prove to myself I can do that too! Even if it may take slightly longer, it's always a good learning exercise. :) 
> + Learning anything is a physical process! When you begin learning something, the strength of your neural pathways is low, but repetition tells your body "this is important" and things like myelin production will increase. Myelin is responsible for 'insulating' your axons, and the presence of it allows your brain to transmit impulses much faster then 'un-myelinated' axons.
