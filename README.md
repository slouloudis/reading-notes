## Growth Mindset :thinking:

A growth mindset is *essential* to personal development. It's the ability to take a positive, can-do attitude, especially when facing unfamiliar tasks or trying to learn a new skill. To give an example from my personal life, many people see being artistic as an inborn talent - I know this isn't true, it's just that most artists started young and kept going. It's persistence and **focused** practice that lead to great work, not an innate ability. 

However reading through the article, I related to the authors tendency to sometimes throw his hands up and avoid the issue. To try and improve my own growth mindset, especially at this essential time where I'm beginning a tough course, I need to remind myself of the following: 

> - It's okay to get criticism. While it can feel a bit painful in the moment, constructive criticisms is just someone trying to help you push your abilities to their best. Take a breath and properly think about what they said. 
> * Try to find inspiration in others - I always feel more motivated when I see peers create something new, or interesting projects on the internet. I feel the urge to prove to myself I can do that too! Even if it may take slightly longer, it's always a good learning exercise. :) 
> + Learning anything is a physical process! When you begin learning something, the strength of your neural pathways is low, but repetition tells your body "this is important" and things like myelin production will increase. Myelin is responsible for 'insulating' your axons, and the presence of it allows your brain to transmit impulses much faster then 'un-myelinated' axons. 


## Read 01 - Learning Markdown 

Learning Markdown now will help me in the future as I create reading notes for other modules. Being able to organise my notes and easily quote code will make the learning process much easier. Github pages also allows me to access them from anywhere, which is just a *little* conveniant. **There are many markdown applications, although most of them generally support the same syntax.**

#### Markdown Basic Syntax


The `#` sign is used for creating headers. If you want to make a `<h3>` tag like in html, you use the corresponding number of `#`s.

To create a code block use a single tab (or four spaces if you just love pressing the space button). 

To show something is a peice of code, you can use back-ticks. Like I did above! ``Use double`back`ticks if you want backticks in your code example. Backtick inception!``

`***`, `___` and `---` can be used to make a horizontal line. 

You can even show colours: `#DC143C` although this only works in issues, pull requests and discussions on GitHub. 

#### Github Pages

GitHub pages is an easy way to host and share websites for projects, organisations and resumes. The source files for the sight will come straight from your repository. Keep in mind, even if your repo is private, the pages website will be public. 

## Things I want to know more about

Useing Jekyl themes for Pages and creating a small website for all my learning notes. I'm also trying to get used to flex and gridbox this week! I also want to get a basic understanding of what a framework like React.js accutally does (right now I think it's like a library of code?) and also what as static site generator is and how to use one. 

##### Static Sites vs Dynamic Sites. 

Satic Sites are the same for whatever viewer looks at them - like this one! You could think of it as a 'read-only' site. While it can be interactive and have animation, the users *actions* cannot change the site. They require minial back end processing, as most things tend to be rendered client-side.
