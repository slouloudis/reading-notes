## Growth Mindset 
A growth mindset is *esential* to personal development. It's the abilitiy to take a positive, can-do attitude, especailly when facing unfimilar tasks or trying to learn a new skill. To give an example from my personal life, many people see being artistic as an inborn talent - I know this isn't true, it's just that most artists started young and kept going. It's persistance and **focused** practice that leads to great work, not inate ability. 

However reading through the article, I related to the authors tendancy to sometimes throw his hands up and avoid the issue. To try and improve my own growth mindset, especially at this essential time where I'm begining a tough course, I need to remind myself of the following: 

> - one
> * two
> + three
