# Version Control 

Version control is a filing system that makes you avoid doing the classic project_final_final02 that I remember fondly from my many .psd files. While project_final_final02 isn't a very good version control system (**VCS**) it *is* one, just very prone to error. Let's look at a better one. 

## Local Version Control 

My example above would be a local version control system. It's maybe a folder on my harddrive, or a database, where I store all my changes. When doing 3d work it was pretty common to use projectname_001, projectname_002 ect all in a pretty strict projects file. This isn't really made to be shared with others, or stored off my local drive. 

## Centralized Version Control. 

What if we need multiple people to be able to make changes? We could upload all of our files to a server, that stores all changes/file versions from multiple users. This is much better for collaboration (an admin could restric acces to files). There are still some issues...

## Distributed Version Control 

What if our CVC server goes down? Or someone sets fire to our server? Or a kaiju attacks? None of our workers wil be able to work! Instead of relying on a single point of contact (our Centralized Server) lets distribute our files among all our workers, so we have mirrors of all our files.
