# JavaScript Basics

## Hello, world!

Use `console.log("");` to print out data. 

There are three ways to declare variables in JavaScript, although they share a basic format: 

`keyword variableName = data;`

The three keywords are as follows:-

- **var** - a variable - try not to use it. 
- **const** - declairs local constant (variable can't be changed)
- **let** - declares a local variable. 

### Scope

___

**Scope** determines what code can use what variables. Generally, local variables can only be accessed from {code blocks inside curly braces}
